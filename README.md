# Learning PHP: The Non-Garbage Way
_By Alex Billson_

## Overview

The main reason I've written this guide is so that I have
a decent reference to give people when they come to me
asking about PHP.

Let me preface this by saying I no longer do much dev work
in PHP; much more on the .NET side of things these days so
whilst I still do web development it's more with tech
such as ASP.NET and more frontend technologies.

This repo doesn't exist to provide a comprehensive 
tutorial, if anything just set the foundations for
someone who's _moderately interested_ in PHP. There is
an emphasis on PHP as both a scripting and a web language,
so keep this in mind when I write a couple of examples
using the Command Line as a target not a browser.

This tutorial cannot be taken as the tutorial to end all 
tutorials. There's plenty of those on the internet and I
recommend you do some snooping around after this tutorial
or look into large PHP projects like CakePHP and Laravel
if you're interested in developing large PHP applications.
